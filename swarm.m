%--------------------------SWARM------------------------------------------%
%A swarm is an object that is composed of two or more drones. It inherits
%properties from the handle class. 
%
%CONSTRUCTOR
%The class constructor takes 4 inputs (ID,type,systems,IC)
%1.ID: is a number that uniquely identifies the swarm
%2.type: is a string that describes the function of the swarm
%3.systems: is a table that describes the size and requirements of each
%   sub-swarm. The table headers are [dTypes,dPop,dNeed], where they are the
%   type of drone, the drone population, and the required drones for mission
%   success respectively. 
%4.IC: are the initial conditions of the swarm. These are part of a vector
%   that stores the starting keplerian coordinates [a,e,i,Omega,w,M], where
%   -a: semi-major axis of the deployer's orbit [km]
%   -e: eccentricity of the deployer's orbit
%   -i: inclination of the deployer's orbit [rad]
%   -Omega: right ascension of the ascending node """ [rad]
%   -w: angle of periapse [rad]

    methods
        %CONSTRUCTOR: receives ID,type, systems, and ICs as inpuTs, and
        %generates a swarm with those properties.

        %BUILD NETWORK: instantiate all the members of a sawrm, and assigns
        %them a place in the network. The drone arrays are arranged 
        %horizontally on the basis of type, and then stacked vertically. 
        %Because the sub-swarm sizes may vary, the vertical arrays are
        %nested in the horizotnally arranged cells, so that two cell calls
        %are required to reach any drone.

        %netowrk, causing its initial conditions to change before

        %be propagated separately, since each propagation occurs throughout
        %the entire time of the clock.
